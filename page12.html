Almost every building, painting and even pieces of music had a religiously tinted subject. When you look back at this time, it seems like all was great, without any obstacles. But the truth is that a lot was going on back then. The people were suffering, life was hard. Only the rich and high-class people had power and securities. Surely, this is why they almost did not suffer from the black death, when the normal classes were soaked in misery. Looking at mental health or nature, we can assure that this wasn't the main topics, appearance rise above.&nbsp;</p>

Nature was the source of many discoveries. Mainly aspects considering science. Science was the head topic during this time. Due to science, smallpox could be rimmed. A vaccine was quickly developed. According to this, religion, spirituality or mental health were put in the corner. Nevertheless, those aspects were still alive but on the background. The most important things were facts.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-4">Due to the colonies, which were very present all over the world, new exotic things could spread on a global scale. People discovered new forms of art, exotic plants and flowers and many more. It was a great time full of glory. But along with this great new experiences, the virus came. Colonies from all over the world spread this disease. And in this time full of industrial revolution and working in factories, there was no place for mental health or physical sickness. There wasnâ€™t even a place for religion or hope. People who were sick or people who were too busy praying for mercy belonged to the bottom of society.<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

                            <strong>World War I</strong><br><em>The Spanish Flu&nbsp;</em></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-4">In the painting, you can see a lot of symbolics. Mental health was very important. During the war, many men felt their families and fought for their homeland. They came back, a lot suffered because of the traumatic experiences from PTSD. A lot of forests and other areas got ruined because of the war. People craved a beautiful field or forest. It reminded them of the happy times before the war and diseases. People began to believe again and found their refuge in religion. During these times, culture and arts changed. It became more and more positive. Almost every painting, sculpture, or art piece had a positive, happy, and loving symbolic. It was a period of revival in every aspect. <br>Nevertheless, when the soldiers came back from the war they spread a very contagious and infected disease, named the Spanish flu. <br>At the frontlines, many soldiers fought for their lives, but they didn't know that they were spreading a disease, that lead to a pandemic. Partying became something negative, because of the spreading of the disease. The piece of art shows its symbolic aspect. In the foreground, you can see people kissing, but the background shows the horrible consciences of this time.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-4">Mental health was strongly present at this time. People were still living up to what they had experienced in times of war. They were often depressed or had anxiety disorders. From a social point of view, these problems were not yet accepted and feelings were put away as much as possible. Nature is not present in these times. It was not an aspect that was vitally important, or that they helped in coping with the problems. The only medium in which people could show their feelings was in art and culture. An image is created with different emotions of women. These women seem strong and happy, but the opposite is true. Frida in the foreground looks as if she has to bear the suffering of the world. In these times there were also many diseases that plagued the populations. HIV was one of the greatest. Homosexuals were automatically seen as carriers. It was a punishment from God. Because of this, extra attention was paid to religion, which was back from the past.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-4">During corona, mental health is strongly present. It should be important, people should take account of each other and their health, but unfortunately, this is not the case. When it comes to nature, we are more attentive. In times of corona, nature is seen as a refuge. People go for walks to enjoy the company and the landscape. In terms of art and culture, we can conclude that people have different needs. They forget that these parts exist and are part of our society. Religion is seen as a kind of refuge, but also as punishment. Corona is a punishment from God. Different rituals and others that are important for carrying out beliefs can not be fully accomplished. They are limited by the active virus. That is why we must emphasize and highlight these different aspects. This is how the corona image came into being.&nbsp;<br></p>
